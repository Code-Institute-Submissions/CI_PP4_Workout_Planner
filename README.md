## Design

### Colours

The colour scheme was chosen to provide simple, neutral and fresh look. It was an intention to keep the website for all range of users and avoid colour stereotype typically found in the gyms and sports centres such as bright green or blue.

These colours were used throughout all the pages in such a way to ensure adequate contrast and good user experience.

The pallet created using [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)

3. Click on create app
4. Go to "Settings"
5. Under Config Vars store any sensitive data you saved in .json file. Name 'Key' field, copy the .json file and paste it to 'Value' field. Also add a key 'PORT' and value '8000'.
6. Add required buildpacks (further dependencies). For this project, I set up 'Python' and 'node.js' in that order.
7. Go to "Deploy" and select "GitHub" in "Deployment method"
8. To link up our Heroku app to our Github repository code enter your repository name, click 'Search' and then 'Connect' when it shows below
9.  Choose the branch you want to buid your app from
10. If prefered, click on "Enable Automatic Deploys", which keeps the app up to date with your GitHub repository
11. Wait for the app to build. Once ready you will see the ‚ÄúApp was successfully deployed‚Äù message and a 'View' button to take you to your deployed link.
